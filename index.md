It is funded by the [Leibniz Association](https://www.leibniz-gemeinschaft.de/en) in the funding scheme [Collaborative Excellence](https://www.leibniz-gemeinschaft.de/en/research/leibniz-competition/leibniz-collaborative-excellence).

This is the website of the TIB branch of the project. We will report on the TIB team's progress regarding
- the exploration of user interaction data for better understanding of remote video learning;
- the development of automatic methods for the analysis of the complexity of learning videos.
